## Explaining this repository
- The original project was to create a website using Javascript (with any web development stack) to show graphs of data and have a login system to upload new graph data. This data was related to heat consumption etc. in the UK, and included multiple .csv files.
- The project was originally created on a private GitLab.
- This was a group project, so I only pushed my work to this repository. Therefore, it cannot function properly from this repository.
- This just functions as a way to view the code I wrote for the group project (from Novemeber and December 2023).
- Any sensitive data has been changed in the files.
- Any imports with original paths to files are left to show how the files were orginally laid out in the private repository.
- This was developed using the MERN stack.
- Tests are written using Jest.
